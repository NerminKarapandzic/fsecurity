# fsecurity
Spring boot library for simple authentication and authorization

This is a simple library I created to use for my side projects when I don't want to deal with Spring Security. I planned to make it open source and publish on maven central but I'm too lazy for that :)

You can check some examples on how to use it here: https://melodic-liger-730146.netlify.app/getting-started/configuration.html
Ignore the parts of the documentation that explain how to install the package. It's NOT published anywhere.
